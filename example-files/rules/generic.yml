type: YAML
files:
  - "*.config"

# For generic YAML linting, we need a list of resources
# Each entry in the list describes the resource type, how to discover it in the file, and how to get its ID
# The key attribute is a JMESPath expression that should return an array

resources:
  - type: widget
    key: widgets[]
    id: id
  - type: gadget
    key: gadgets[]
    id: name
  - type: contraption
    key: other_stuff.contraptions[]
    id: ids.serial_number
  # include the root document in a single element array with a literal id
  - type: document
    key: '[@]'
    id: '`"Document"`'
