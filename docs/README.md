# 🔍 config-lint 🔎

A command line tool to validate configuration files using rules specified in YAML. The configuration files can be one of several formats: Terraform, JSON, YAML, with support for Kubernetes. There are built-in rules provided for Terraform, and custom files can be used for other formats.

## Quick Start

Install the latest version of config-lint on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

``` bash
brew tap stelligent/tap
brew install config-lint
```

Or manually on Linux:

``` bash
curl -L https://github.com/stelligent/config-lint/releases/latest/download/config-lint_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz -C /usr/local/bin config-lint
chmod +rx /usr/local/bin/config-lint
```

Run the built-in ruleset against your Terraform files. For instance if you want to run config-lint against our [example files](https://github.com/stelligent/config-lint/tree/master/example-files):

``` bash
config-lint -terraform example-files/config
```

You will see failure and warning violations in the output like this:
``` bash
[
  {
    "AssertionMessage": "viewer_certificate[].cloudfront_default_certificate | [0] should be 'false', not ''",
    "Category": "resource",
